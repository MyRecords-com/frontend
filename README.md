### Why I chose this project concept:
- I have a strong passion for music, am a vinyl enthusiast, and have DJ’d in the past. A platform like is a fantastic way for vinyl enthusiasts, DJs, and music producers to discover new vinyl and connect with what the world is collectively listening to. I envisioned that over time as this platform transforms into a full blown marketplace, that it becomes the go-to online destination for the vinyl community.

### Why I chose Django for my final project:
- I chose Django because I first wanted to challenge myself. I secondly chose Django because I know that it is a popular language that I may come across in my future work, and wanted to begin to better understand its relevent stack and it’s capabilities.

### What it could be in the future:
- User-centric marketplace wherein usrs can add, share, and create vinyl collections publicly, as well as buy and trade vinyl
- Albums can be added by producers/artists (suppliers) for commericial sale
